The repository Car-Price-Predictor contains a machine learning project developed to predict car prices using Linear Regression. The project includes a dataset of car features and prices, a Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, as well as the final trained model. The code demonstrates the application of Linear Regression to estimate car prices based on various attributes such as mileage, year, and make. The repository also provides instructions on how to run the project and visualize the results.
